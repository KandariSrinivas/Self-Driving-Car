# Self-Driving-Car
This is a Course Project from the course "Artificial Intelligence A-Zâ„¢: Learn How To Build An AI" on Udemy

Built a Deep Q- Network using torch that takes in state of
the car and gives the Q-values of actions and the Policy(Network) gets updated based on the output(Reward and Next State Value) of the
action(Value-Iteration). The car and the environment in the project are built using the kivy library in python(Provided by Instructor). The
goal is to make the network learn a policy using which the car can go from start to destination without crashing.
